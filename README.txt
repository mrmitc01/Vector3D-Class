Vector3D-Class

This code is used to implement a three-dimensional vector class using JavaScript's built in Class syntax.

The purposes of each of the following files are stated below:


Vec3.js - to provide an implementation of a three-dimensional vector class that is immutable, where none of the functions on the class modify the vector's properties, and returns a new vector with the computed value

Vec3.spec.js - to test the vector program

package-lock.json - package lock file pinning specific version of all packages used

package.json - package file listing dependencies and information


Node.js will need to be installed, which can be downloaded from: https://nodejs.org/en/.

Run the source code by typing the following at the prompt >:
